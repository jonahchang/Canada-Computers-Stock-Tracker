# Canada Computers Stock Tracker (CCST)

A Python-based automation tool that tracks **real-time inventory** of products across all Canada Computers stores, including **online availability**, and compiles weekly stock reports into **Excel spreadsheets** for historical trend analysis.  

This project combines **web automation, data engineering, and visualization** into a complete pipeline for market research, business intelligence, and supply chain monitoring.

## Features  

- **Automated Stock Collection**  
  - Uses Selenium WebDriver to scrape product pages directly from Canada Computers.  
  - Detects **per-store inventory counts** (`0`, exact number, or `10+`) by parsing DOM class markers (`bg-0000001` for 0, `bg-E3E9F8` for in-stock).  
  - Tracks **online shipping availability** (Available to Ship / Sold Out Online).  
  - Supports arbitrary ordering of stores in the webpage while outputting results in a consistent predefined order.  

- **Excel Integration**  
  - Generates weekly stock reports in a single `.xlsx` workbook.  
  - Automatically formats category and product tables with:  
    - **Merged category cells** spanning product rows  
    - Per-store stock columns  
    - Online availability  
    - **Individual product totals**  
    - **Category totals**  
    - **Out-of-stock counts**  
  - Color-coded highlighting of weekly changes:  
    - ðŸŸ© **Green** â†’ Stock increase  
    - ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow** â†’ Stock decrease  
    - ðŸŸ¦ **Blue** â†’ Availability appeared/disappeared  

- **Charts & Visualization**  
  - Multi-line charts showing **model stock trends** across weeks.  
  - Category-level summaries for broader inventory insight.  
  - Store-level summaries to analyze **regional distribution**.  

- **Product Management UI**  
  - Tkinter-based editor for adding/removing tracked products.  
  - JSON-based product lists for persistence and version control.  
  - Reset option to restore original datasets.  

- **Debugging & Transparency**  
  - Saves raw scraping logs (store element HTML vs extracted stock values).  
  - Console debug output links each **store â†’ matched HTML â†’ parsed stock**.  
  - Debug history appended to file for reference across runs.
